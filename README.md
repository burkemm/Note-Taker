**What's the result of my work for this app?** <BR />
I'm able to make a note maker app fully function now. This assignment was precoded, but it was missing the routes to make the
app work on both ends. So I added the routes with notes explaining the code and what it does.

**What did I learn from this assignment?** <BR />
I learned how routes work to connect the front end and back end of an app. I also developed better research skills by
going to youtube and watching some videos.
